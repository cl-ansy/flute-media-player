Browser based media player

Add local media files (image, audio, video, etc) to a webpage to play locally (no upload).

Hopefully store a reference to those files somewhere in local storage.

Take advantage of browser media encoding to play files in a queue.

Play local files easily with Chromecast via tab casting, woo.
