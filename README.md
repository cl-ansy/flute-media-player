# Flute Media Player

Browser based media player

- Add local media files (image, audio, video, etc) to a webpage to play locally (no upload).
- Store a reference to those files (playlist) somewhere in local storage.
- Take advantage of browser media encoding to play files in a queue.
- Play local files easily with Chromecast via tab casting.
